# The many resource games of WoW

An encounter is a game in which a group of characters in the game world, each controlled by a player, engage in battle with a group of enemies, which are controlled by the computer. Think of it like Chess, but against the computer and with each of the pieces on your side controlled by an individual person. Characters controlled by players are called - naturally enough - player characters, or PCs. Characters controlled by the computer are called NPCs, an acronym for, you guessed it, Non-Player Characters.

NPCs fall into three categories: normal mobs, elites and bosses. 'Mob' here is short for 'mobile unit', and is singular as opposed to a collective noun. A mob may be easy or tough for an individual player to defeat, but usually are only dangerous in numbers.

An elite is an especially tough mob, which will be challenging for an individual player to defeat. A boss is much more tough again, and invariably needs a team of players to defeat.

Each character has an amount of a resource called 'health'. When this reaches zero, the player is defeated, and their character dies. Their spirit then appears at the nearest graveyard, and the player's ghost must run back to their corpse to revive (at reduced health). Players may recover their health through resting and eating, by using items such as bandages and healing potions, or through the use of special abilities e.g. healing spells.

Each character can do damage, either with a melee weapon (staff,spear, sword or the like) or a ranged weapon (bow, wand etc.) All characters have special attacks the are unique to their class, e.g.

    Slam
    Cost: 15 Rage
    Melee Range
    Requires Warrior
    Requires Melee Weapon
    Slams the opponent, causing weapon damage plus 32.

So 'Slam' is an ability unique to the Warrior class, that requires a melee weapon to be equipped, and slams into the opponent causes 32 points of damage on top of the weapon's usual damage. Slam also uses 15 points of Rage, a resource unique to Warriors, which we'll come back to later.

Most NPCs also have special abilities. Some of these affect only a single target, and some of these are AOE (Area-Of-Effect) abilities that cause damage to any character standing within their area of effect. Some abilities may be avoided, either by running out of the area, or by moving out of the way of an ability, or by breaking LOS (Line-Of-Sight) to the enemy.

Damage is mitigated by armour, the more armour you're wearing, the less damage you take. The type of armour affects how efficient it is at reducing damage. Cloth armour is the least effective, then leather, mail and finally plate which is the most effective. Only certain classes can wear plate (e.g. Warriors). Some classes, typically spell-casters like Priests and Mages, can only wear cloth, and so try and stay out of melee combat with mobs, damaging them from afar. Because they are more susceptible to damage they are referred to as 'squishy'.

When an enemy mob's health is reduced to zero, it is defeated and dies. Although enemy units don't revive in the same way that PCs do, they do eventually 'respawn'.

So basically the game in an encounter is to reduce all of the opposing NPCs health to zero whilst keeping all of the players' health above zero.

'Simple',you say. Not so fast. In order to stop you from just spamming (reusing again and again) your most powerful attack, each class has a limited resource. For spell-casters this is 'mana' or magical energy. For Warriors it is Rage, for Monks it is Chi, etc. This resource is gained in various ways, usually by using particular techniques that are collectively referred to as 'resource generators'. Typically these don't do much damage. Then that resource can be used on 'resource spenders' that do more damage, but use precious resource. Many abilities have some sort of cool-down, a period which after using they cannot be used again. This implies the use of a 'rotation' of special abilities, I use A (which has a 4-second cool-down) and then B to generate resource, then I spend it on C, then start the cycle again now that A is back off cool-down.

There are also abilities which will unpredictably trigger on certain conditions, called 'procs' (Programmed Random Occurrences), which expire in a few seconds and must be taken advantage of to maximise your character's damage output.

In a simple 1v1 encounter (player vs NPC unit) the following game of resources and constraints are in play:

* The player cannot run out of health, or they lose
* The player's objective is to reduce the enemy mob's health to zero
* The player has to use abilities, and positioning to avoid or mitigate as much of the mob's damage as possible
* The player must keep the mob in range, and in a position that their abilities can be used (you can't target something that is behind you, for example)
* The player must try and make the best use of resource generators and resource spenders
* Resource generated when the players is at max ('cap') of resource is wasted
* The player must try and avoid or interrupt NPC abilities that will stun or otherwise cause the player to temporarily lose control of their character
* The player must try and interrupt the most dangerous NPC abilities to reduce their damage output

This is 1v1.

In a dungeon, the party is composed of five player characters:

* One tank
* One healer
* Three damage-dealing classes (DPS, Damage-Per-Second)

The Tank's role is to keep the NPC mobs focused on themselves, and mitigate the majority of damage, they do this by using abilities that generate threat. All damage generates threat, but Tanks have special abilities that generate more threat than the damage they do.

The Healer's role is to heal the tank and keep it (and the rest of the party) alive. Because healing also generates threat (though at a lower rate than damage), if the Tank loses the attention of a mob, usually the player that it will run to is the healer. Because healers tend to be squishy spell-casters, this doesn't usually end well unless the tank picks it up or one of the DPS players wades in and deals with it.

The DPS's role is to wear down the NPCs, without generating so much threat that they pull the mob away from the tank. If that happens, because they don't have the armour and other mitigation abilities of the tank.

Each encounter is composed of a variety of mechanics:

* The tank has a resource (Fury for Demon Hunters, Rage for Warriors) that they use to spend on abilities, that generate threat (and do damage) to the mobs. A few abilities generate this resource, most abilities spend it. It is the intention that the tank is always highest on the mob's threat table.
* The healer has a resource (usually mana) that they use for healing. This resource regenerates quickly when out of combat, but hardly at all during an encounter, and even then healing spell mana cost greatly outstrips regen.
* The DPS use resources to do damage to mobs.
* Mobs use normal and special abilities to do damage to whichever target has the highest threat for them.
* The tank has Health, which is depleted by damage. The tank has armour, which mitigates some of the mob's damage. When the tank reaches zero health, they die, and the mob then goes and attacks whoever is second on their threat list.

So you can see that it is a race. The tank needs to keep the mobs' attention, which the DPS need to kill, whilst the healer needs to keep everyone alive. The tank has the highest armour, so the objective is that the tank takes most of the damage.

a) If the tank runs out of health, the group wipes;
b) If the healer runs out of mana, the group wipes;
c) If the DPS can't do enough damage to kill the mobs before a) or b) happens, the group wipes;
d) If the tank can't generate enough threat to keep the attention of the mobs, they'll go after the healer, who is squishy and will die, and the group wipes;
e) If the DPS out-run the tank's threat generation on a mob, the mob will come after them. They aren't able to mitigate the mob's damage the way a tank can, so they take lots of damage, and the healer will get distracted trying to keep them alive, and then the tank dies, and the group wipes;
f) Often mobs have special abilities (like creating a pool of fire on the ground underneath a player) which players will have to move quickly to avoid. If too many players stand in the fire, then the healer runs out of mana, and then the tank dies, and the group wipes;
g) ... (many variations of the above)

In short, there are several different games going on at the same time, and these need to be balanced in such a way as to achieve a successful outcome. A trash mob group encounter takes perhaps sixty seconds at most, so as a team you're trying to play your own game, help others with their game and as a group succeed, all whist adapting to changing circumstances in real-time.

This requires quick thinking, an understanding of the mobs special abilities, an understanding of the other players' abilities, and an adaptability to changing circumstances that allows your response to be agile in the face of uncertain conditions.

In short, an excellent training ground for the cut-and-thrust of day-to-day business activity.
