# Shadowlands - the level 48 to 60 journey

From level 48 onwards you can travel to the Shadowlands, and it's probably best to start at 48 rather than wait till 50. The main questline in the Shadowlands will take you all the way to level 60 before you've completed it, even if you enter the Shadowlands early at level 48 and even if you don't do any side quests.
You can tell which quests are on the main quest line because they are surrounded with a  shield; ordinary quest NPCs have no surround to the question mark that appears above their heads.

Shadowlands consists of four questing zones, which you will adventure through in order;

* Bastion
* Maldraxxus
* Ardenweald
* Revendreth

Each zone's quest line finishes with taking you back to Oribos and opening up the next zone. There is also a fifth zone, the Maw, which is the zone that you landed in when you first came to Shadowlands. Later on you will open up a new 6th zone called Korthia, but that doesn't happen until after you've hit level cap (60).

# Covenants

The main quest line ends with your character choosing a covenant; this will be one of the four covenants each of which represents one of the first four zones that you requested in.

* Kyrian (Bastion)
* Necrolords (Maldraxxus)
* Night Fae (Ardenweald)
* Venthyr (Revendreth)

Take a look on the Icy Veins guide for your character in order to determine what your choices of covenant should be and what the various pros and cons are for each choice. Although it is possible to change your choice of covenant it is not easy and will take some work, so choose wisely. Consider the tradeoffs if you plan to use a different spec, because the 'best' covenant for one spec may well be the worst for a different spec, and choosing a second best for both may be a better choice than a covenant that is great for one spec but bad for another. This is particularly valuable if you plan to off-spec to tank or healer from DPS, for instance.

# Professions

As with each of the previous expansions all professions in Shadowlands are independent of the same profession in a previous expansion. Alchemy in Battle for azeroth is different from alchemy in Legion is different from alchemy in Shadowlands, none of the progression in previous expansions carries over into Shadowlands. Each profession starts anew in Shadowlands when you get to the central city: Oribos, and learn a Shadowlands version of your profession. For this reason it doesn't pay to get attached to progressing any profession before you get into Shadowlands. I would advise taking herbalism and mining as your two professions whilst levelling 10-48 just for the boost that it gives to experience points when levelling (four or five plants or mining nodes equals a whole quest).

After you have completed the introductory questline in Shadowlands in the Maw you will be directed to the central city of Oribos, this is where you will learn the Shadowlands version of the professions that you want to take to the end of the game. Although it is possible to just continue with The same strategy of taking mining and herbalism that you did previously this might not be so advantageous because certain professions (Tailoring, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking) give useful equipment that can help you whilst levelling, and already having levelled up your professions as you go on the journey to 60 can mean you've done half the work without really noticing it.

# Dungeons

Unlike in previous expansions that you have been leveling in there is no mechanism to allow characters to do dungeons together irrespective of their level. Unlike the leveling zones, in Shadowlands there is both an introductory quest which you need to do in order to access the dungeon, a level requirement i.e. a minimum level to attain, and an item level requirement. Each of the members of the party needs to fulfill *all three* requirements in order to be able to access the dungeon. This makes partying up for dungeons whilst on the journey to 60 much much more difficult than between levels 10 and 50. Much of these problems disappear when you get to level 60, and all of the shadowlands dungeons are available.

# Threads of Fate

Once you have been through the entire main quest line on a single character, alts have the option to do Threads of Fate, this is a new system which enables you to skip the entire main quest line once you have done the introductory story in the Maw and got to Oribos. This enables you to choose a covenant immediately and to level in whichever zone you prefer, all of the dungeons become available to you immediately, without level, quest or ilvl requirements. This is an advantage because it enables you to gain renown with your covenant as you level.
