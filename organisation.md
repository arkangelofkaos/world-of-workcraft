# Organisation

In WoW,companies are called Guilds. Each guild is created by a guild leader, who has control over guild membership, and the guild bank. 
[This guide](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guild) contains some interesting info for new players:

> Guilds offer many benefits including free items, opportunities for groups, access to trade skill masters, quest items, and readily available trade skill ingredients through gathering guild members. You may discover that a guild greatly enhances your gameplay experience. You can meet friends, share adventures, and find people to protect you if you fight in faction versus faction combat. Typically, players in good guilds can reach content that those not in a guild cannot. A good example of this is high level raiding content and dungeons.
> Keep in mind that guilds are run by players and not Blizzard. The quality of the guild and the guild experience depends entirely on the players in that guild. Guilds can be a grab bag where you never know what you'll get. Every guild is different.
> Finding a guild can be very easy. People often sit in town asking anyone to join their guild because guilds require a minimum number of members to create. However, finding a quality guild with quality members and leadership can be a difficult task. Don't be afraid to shop around. You can join one guild, try it out, then leave and join another guild until you find one you like.

> NOTE: You can move from guild to guild, but this will not enhance your reputation as time goes on. Sometimes the best thing to do is try to make your guild better and leave if that fails. Guilds will be more reluctant to invite you if you have the reputation of joining, taking what you need, and leaving for the next guild that has something better. 

Sound familiar?

I'm interested in getting a group to agree on how they set up their ~~company~~guild, covering such areas as:

* How should the division of labour work?
* What constitutes fair compensation?
* Should certain members get more rewards than others?
* Do we adopt pay for performance?
* Who can recruit,and kick, members from the guild?
* What should constitute the guild's code of conduct?
* What punishments are appropriate for breaching that code of conduct?
* Who decides the strategic vision?
* How is the guild organised? e.g. is there a hierarchy?
* If more people are available and want to participate in an activity than it allows, how are people chosen for the team? (like choosing amongst 8 people for a 5-a-side football game)

These are not esoteric, philosophical decisions, they have real consequences, they affect members' lived experience of playing the game, and the fun that they get out of it. It may not be affecting a P&L, or peoples' pay packets, but it is a real effect nonetheless.

How will you decide?
