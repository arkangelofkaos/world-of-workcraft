# Personal log: stardate 2021-07-07

We had our first meeting on the evening of Wed 7 July, we had a round of introductions and then discussed what we wanted to accomplish. Apart from myself, present were (in alphabetical order) Alex, Chris, Lynn, Marta and Michal.

Our agenda was small: introductions, mission and the issue of guild membership.

I took the group through an exercise in consensus-based decision-making in order to decide an important issue: whether we would allow people into the guild who weren't professional managers or leaders. The group after discussion decided that as long as we were open and transparent in our aims and objectives as a guild, and the new members accepted our mission and code of conduct, then we were happy to accept them on our journey.

In the matter of a name we had several proposals, my original 'Just Managing' was dismissed as it was felt not to appeal to non-management types; it was interesting here that the group was already thinking of marketing and branding elements of the organisation, without prompting.

We discussed how we would advertise the project, and Chris suggested that he could post on his blog on Medium as he has the largest social media following of the group. We all agreed to collaborate on a post using Google Docs, which Chris would edit and post.

The agenda being complete and there being no other business, we adjourned to complete in-game activities for the rest of the evening, including signing the guild charter - this is an in-game artefact that requires 5 signatures from players. It turned out that trial accounts cannot sign guild charters, so with only three signatures we deferred this to our next meeting.
