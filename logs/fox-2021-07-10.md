## Dungeon - Freehold

Freehold is the first, lowest level Kul'Tiras dungeon, available from level 10 onwards. Each dungeon requires a team of five players, split between three roles: one tank, one healer and three DPS (Damage Per Second). The in-game Adventure Guide describes it thus:

> Freehold has traditionally served as a haven for pirates, scoundrels, and those who wish to live free of Kul Tiran control. Now the Irontide Raiders have brought the city under their harsh rule and are coercing the various pirate crews under their banner. While the pirates gather, a small group of heroes must infiltrate the town and eliminate their leadership to dissolve this growing alliance of cutthroats.

Myself, Lynn and Alex had previously run Freehold as DPS to try it out, using the Dungeon Finder tool in-game to find a tank and healer. It had gone reasonably well.

Me: level 23 Mistweaver Monk (healer)
Alex: level 24 Vengeance Demon Hunter (tank)
Lynn: level 31 Balance Druid (DPS)

Now we had decided to try it 'for real', with Alex tanking and myself healing. We'd queued in the Dungeon Finder and almost instantly got a group - because healers, and especially tanks, are in shorter supply than DPS. Alex had pulled the first group of mobs (short for 'mobile units', slang from the early days of the game) and we'd managed OK, then the second and things hadn't gone so well because another group of mobs had aggro'd (noticed and joined the fight) and our team had gotten overwhelmed and we wiped (everyone dies and has to rejoin the instance from the entry portal - called a 'corpse run').

We had then worked our way up the stairs to the left, searching for a path through to the first boss fight of the dungeon, Skycap'n Kragg. One of the randoms (a player randomly assigned to your group from the queue), presumably being impatient with Alex's inexperience in marking and pulling mobs, decided to go and pull a group of mobs back to the tank. This unfortunately coincided with Alex pulling a different group, and under the weight of both groups the team wiped, again.

The other two players quit, and we were left on our own. We made the decision to proceed, using the opportunity to practise pulling trash mobs (static or free-roaming groups that are not associated with a boss). The pull, the initial part of a fight where the tank gets the attention of a group of mobs and then moves them to a good position for the fight to take place, and orients them such that the rest of the group is in a good position, is like the opening game of chess, and the most important part of an encounter.

Needless to say, this takes practice. We spent perhaps an hour or so practising, and at one stage after perhaps fifteen to twenty minutes were at a low ebb after several wipes. It is hard with only three players, doing encounters that were designed for five. Healers tend to run out of mana if the fight takes too long, and with only one out of three DPS present this was constantly marginal. We managed to make the encounters more manageable by using two different strategies:

* Focus on a single mob, kill it, move on to the next. A mob does the same amount of damage whether it is at full health or at 1% health, so reducing the number of mobs from four to three removes 25% of the damage input to the tank;
* Crowd-control (CC): most classes have an ability that can temporarily incapacitate a single mob, taking them out of the fight until they receive damage, which breaks (removes) CC. Again, removing one mob from a group of four with CC means reducing the damage taken by the tank by 25%.

Both of these are tactics that most of us will be more familiar with under the moniker 'reducing Work-In-Progress', or 'limiting WIP'.
