# Personal log: stardate 2021-07-14

Our second guild meeting was on the 14th of July, present were, apart from myslf, in alphabetical order: Alex, Chris, Lynn, Marta and Michal.

Our agenda covered choosing a guild name, and recruitment.

Several alternatives had already been proposed, and we took a vote; the winner being 'Agile Badgers'.

We discussed how we would advertise the project, and Chris suggested that he could post on his blog on Medium as he has the largest social media following of the group. We all agreed to collaborate on a post using Google Docs, which Chris would edit and post.

We talked about which mediums to advertise in, and whether to use 'traditional' guild recruitment channels e.g. in-game and the Blizzard forums, as compared to more professional channels such as LinkedIn.

Chris had done quite a bit of work to the Medium post, which several others had also contributed to. We agreed that this was most of the way there and we would finalise it at or before the next meeting.
