Our seventh guild meeting was on the 18th of August, and this was our first retrospective. Lynn facilitated a 'Heart of Agile' retrospective. After 'checking-in', agreeing to the [retrospective prime directive](https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive), we collected notes on the four topics:

* Collaborate - how have we fared when collaborating together?
* Deliver - what have we delivered together? How has that gone?
* Reflect - how have we reflected together?
* Improve - what do we want to do differently to improve the way we work together?

We then talked through each of the notes together as a team. At the end we collected actions for the things that we had agreed upon, and added them to our board. The most significant of which is that we decided to change the format of our weekly meetings, switching them to two alternating biweekly meetings:

* A guild topics/progress meeting, in which we walk the board and then talk about notable topics that are part of our current work challenges e.g. gender pay gaps (a major topic last week), and;
* A learn-by-doing meeting, in which we focus on teamwork in-game, and then retrospect afterwards on our performance, and see if we can take what we learn forward into our day-to-day work.

The purpose of this is 'to make training more like work' as Chris says, in the sense of making the meetings more practice-based than just talking. I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out at our next retrospective in September.
