# World of Management

A [MMORPG]()-flavoured exploration of management and leadership.

## Hypothesis

There is a lot we can learn about things like the managment of DAOs (Distributed Autonomous Organisations) and [Servant Leadership]() by studying the creation and evolution of communities in MMOs. These communities are brought together by mutual purpose - in-game achievements, and are entirely volunteer driven - no one is paying a salary! The lack of explicit command and control (financial incentives) leaves the opportunity for alternative leadership strategies.

Plus, it is a safe-to-fail environment to experiment in; nobody goes bankrupt if your organisation doesn't work!

The basic idea is that we come together to play cooperatively to succeed in in-game achievements - something World of Warcraft (WoW) is well known for. These are called 'raids', and require a team of 10-25 people working together, in separate but complimentary roles, to achieve game challenges that require coordination and cooperation. If this sounds quite like the organisation that you work in, then you're beginning to see the possibilities of using this 'simulator' as a crucible for experimentation. 

## General ground rules

1. Don't be an ass
2. See 1.

Slightly more prosaically, I'm adopting this [Code of Conduct](https://opensource.google/conduct/) as a starting point. I'm more than willing for the group to adopt their own code-of-conduct by mutual agreement.

We're a bunch of professionals, we treat each other with respect as a minimum. We're all here to learn, we all have different experiences and and have something to contribute. I certainly have plenty of ideas about this field, but I'd prefer the group to discuss and experiement rather than for it to be my own personal soap-box.

## Previous experience

Back in Wrath of the Lich King (a previous WoW expansion) I co-founded and was raid leader for a successful raiding guild on the Chamber of Aspects server. The guild was based around the central precept of being nice to one another, and helping each other out. This sounds like common sense, but the reality is that most guilds are run by 13-year olds (or at least seem that way), with toxic cronyism, inequitable work distribution, and all the rewards flowing to a privelidged few. This, perhaps, should not be surprising when viewed in juxtaposition with the rest of our society. 

My observation is: we can do better.

I've done it not once, but twice before in the past. I like to say that all the important lessons of leadership and management I learned in World of Warcraft. Professionally I've been a project manager (once I was promoted out of tech), product manager, portfolio manager and CTO. These days I'm a professional coach for software companies.

This time around I'm less interested in execution, but more interested in how a group can use self-reflection and continuous improvement to improve not their outputs, or workflow, but rather the system of work that they work in itself.

If this sounds interesting, drop me a line.
